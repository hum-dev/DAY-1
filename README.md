        Ignoring Markdown formatting
        You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using \ before the Markdown character.

        Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.

        Multiple underscores in words
        Multiple underscores in words are ignored like these: foo_bar_baz.

        Escaping asterisks
        If you don't want to use \ to escape Markdown characters, you can put \ in front of them:

        \*literal asterisks\*

        Ignoring Markdown formatting
        You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using \ before the Markdown character.

        Fenced code blocks
        You can create fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks ``` before and after the code block. We recommend placing a blank line before and after code blocks to make the raw formatting easier to read.
